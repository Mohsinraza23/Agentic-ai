# Agentic AI Series - Class 01

## Introduction
Welcome to the first class of the **Agentic AI Series**! 🎉 In this session, we will focus on setting up your environment for building AI applications, including installing the necessary dependencies and configuring your project to interact with APIs such as **phidata** and **groq**. By the end of this class, you'll have the foundational setup ready to start working with advanced AI tools.

---

## Step 1: Creating the Environment
To get started, we'll create a **Python environment** using Conda. Run the following command to create the environment with **Python version 3.13.1**:

```sh
conda create -p venv python==3.13.1
```

When prompted, type **Yes** to proceed with the creation of the environment.

Once the environment is created, activate it using the following command:

```sh
conda activate venv
```

## Step 2: Creating the `requirements.txt` File
Next, we'll create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the dependencies for our project. Here’s what to include in your `requirements.txt`, with a brief explanation for each library:

```
phidata            # A Python library for working with phidata APIs
python-dotenv      # Loads environment variables from a .env file
yfinance           # Provides access to Yahoo Finance data
packaging          # A tool for packaging Python code
duckduckgo-search  # Allows search queries via DuckDuckGo
fastapi            # A web framework for building APIs quickly
uvicorn            # ASGI server for FastAPI applications
groq               # A library to interact with the groq API
openai             # Python client for OpenAI's GPT API
```

Now, install the dependencies by running:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Step 3: Setting Up Environment Variables
We are using **python-dotenv** to manage environment variables. In your project directory, create a `.env` file that contains the API keys for **phidata** and **groq**.

```
PHI_API_KEY="your_phidata_api_key"
GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key"
```

Make sure to replace the empty strings with your actual API keys. You can get the API keys by signing up on the respective platforms.

## 🎯 That's It for Today!
With the environment set up, dependencies installed, and API keys configured, you're ready to move forward in the **Agentic AI Series**. In the next class, we’ll dive deeper into interacting with these APIs and building a simple application.

### 📌 Notes:
- 🔒 **Make sure to keep your `.env` file safe** and never share it publicly.
- ❗ If you encounter any issues while setting up the environment or installing dependencies, **double-check the Python version and the installation steps**.

Happy coding, and see you in the next class! 🚀😊
